<h1># -Short-Term-Rentals</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <p>It is a online platform for people short-term lending out and renting house. For tenures, the websites provides them with a wide choices of
  available houses that match their accommodations dates. For landlords, it helps people with vacant house to reach a wide range of
  customers and gives them AI recommodations plan to let the vacant day as less as possible.</p>
  
<h2>Background:</h2>
  <p>In summer or winter break, it is normal that students studying abroad will choose to go back to their countries to visit their family, 
  friends and enjoy the hometown food. So that their house will be vacant for
  a period of time. Because they always sign the long-term lease apartment, most of them choose to lend out the house to make up some loss.
  And for those come to the city for a short term time, for example, those who seeking jobs, having training, traveling.They want
  a cheap place to stay. So these study abroad student's house will be their first choice.
  </p>
  <p>As far as I know, currently there is no such specific platform for those people. Usually they go to the local bbs or wechat group
  to spread the rental house information or find the house. But For tenures, it is not easy to find the appropriate house, you have to check the
  house by clicking the url one by one to check. For landlord, it is always hard to combine several tenures to let vacant day as less as possible.
  So My websites focuses on solving these problems, to help poeple to lend out or rent the house easier.</p>
